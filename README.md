This is a fork of Analogue Man's speed running scripts ultimately intended to give a user friendly, self contained way to manage an NTRboot card. To Install extract update.zip, and place the contents of the folder it makes on the root of your R4's SD card.
If your r4 Card already has a version of this script on it, you can extract update.zip to the root of your SD card, then navigate to update>gm9>scripts>Modification_Menu.
In the script select update, r4, and update.
